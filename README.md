# 🍵 Tea Timer

A feature-rich progressive web application (PWA) to help you manage your tea sessions.

It allows you to track the time for each tea infusion, adjust the timer settings, and keep track of the current infusion
count all locally in your browser.

The app supports both Gong Fu Cha and Western-style brewing and comes with predefined tea presets to get you started.

> Gong Fu Cha (功夫茶) is a traditional Chinese tea brewing method that uses a high leaf-to-water ratio and short
> steeping times to extract the best and most nuanced flavors from the tea leaves and to enjoy the tea in multiple
> infusions which reveal different aspects of the tea's flavor profile over time.

#### Use the app [right in your web browser](https://tea-timer.com/).
