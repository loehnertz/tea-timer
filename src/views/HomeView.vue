        <strong>Gong Fu Cha (ÂäüÂ§´Ëå∂)</strong> is a traditional Chinese tea brewing method that uses
        a high leaf-to-water ratio and short steeping times to extract the best and most nuanced
        flavors from the tea leaves. This method allows you to enjoy the tea in many infusions, each
        revealing different aspects of the tea's flavor profile over time.

        learn more about how to do it.

      <p class="content">
        <strong>Western brewing</strong> is the standard method in the West that uses a lower
        leaf-to-water ratio and longer steeping times. This method is more straightforward and
        results in a lot less infusions which extract the tea's flavors at the same time.
